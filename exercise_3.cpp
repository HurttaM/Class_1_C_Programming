/*
Write a program that asks number of students and creates an array of that many integers.
Program then initializes the array elements to -1.
Then the program asks user to enter student number in range 1 â€“ nr of students or zero to stop. If
valid non zero number is given the program asks user to enter grade in the range 0-5 or -1 to not
enter a grade for the student.
When user stops by entering 0 then program prints student numbers followed by grade or N/A if
grade is -1.
